Thank you for giving me an opportunity to introduce myself. My name is OOO. I'm from Korea. In university , I had experience in working in a OOOOO RESORT. And I went to China as an exchange student for 1 years. Then I went to OOOO, OOOO. Also I did a volunteer work for the elderly . my greatest strength is friendly. when I did volunteer , I got so much compliments about my friendly attitude . It was impressive. so I 'm friendly to everyone . I have wanted to be a cabin crew since I was teenager. to be cabin crew might be my dream. however, as I prepared for the interview, i've realized that it's not all about being dream. cabin crew needs to communicate and interact with customers prior to experience that school life's sincerity and friendly for everyone. So my positive attitude and energy are perfect for the job. I want to get an opportunity to interact with diverse people. And I like to work many people with different backgrounds and cultures. And then, I have studied in-flight service management at the OO university. The spaciality of my major is that students study in-flight service for 4 years and prepare for being a flight attendant my classmates and I should wear the uniform and groom ourselves including make-up and hair styling like a real flight attendant while we are in school. The professors make us keep in mind that we are the pre-flight attendants. Thank you.
